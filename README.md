an app for calculating time base on tasks.

### Status: designing

I'm still thinking on it, read README and Issues to find some details.
Or you may get your ideas from this, then please fork to code that.

### Purpose

People are lazy in accomplishing tasks, I think sometimes,
it's mainly because it's hard to see what is happening.
While one task is delayed, one just can't see what's the influence.

For example, the delay may cause the following task to be delayed,
and a whole tasks cannot be achived on time.
Or maybe, since this one is not done in the given time,
similar tasks should be estimated to take more time.
And people just can't see that.

That's why I'm going to make such an app.
Hope that visualizing the time may help people know more about the influences.
And hope that help us manage our own time more simplely.

我觉得任务拖延的原因是人们看不到拖延实际上带来哪些后果,
拖延之后, 实际上导致更多任务被拖延, 以及重新评估时间,
通常人们看不到真正的变化, 如果能看到, 管理任务的方式就强大多了.

因此我想做这样的 App 人们把 Task 记录上去标定时间,
以后的一系列操作 App 都自动重新计算时间的列表, 让人能看懂,
从而达到提醒的目的, 是不是要人能自己考虑清楚后果才知道多严重

就比如晚上几点睡觉, 把任务排了, 把对明天的影响排了,
知道事情会有多严重, 那么提醒的目的也就达到了.
